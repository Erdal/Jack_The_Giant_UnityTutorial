# Jack_The_Giant_UnityTutorial
This is my first tutorial series through Unity a game making engine, a fantastic one at that.
In this game you are jack going down a beanstalk by jumping on clouds. You can collect points and lives, as well as change the difficulty level of your game.
Your high score will save for each difficulty level too, allowing you too keep track of how well you are doing.
You can toggle music and what not too, its a simply game, but it tought me a lot about unity.
i leanred about the best methods to make scenes and how to connect them, how to orginise scripts, and lots of really cool unity methods.
Not to mention a lot of really cool techniques that i can implment accross other games.
